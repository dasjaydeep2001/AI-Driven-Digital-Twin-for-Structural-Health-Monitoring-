# AI-Driven-Digital-Twin-for-Structural-Health-Monitoring-
This project aims to revolutionize structural health monitoring by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), combined with Digital Twin technology. Our goal is to develop a fast-response surrogate model capable of providing real-time safety insights for critical infrastructure, such as bridges and reinforced concrete structures.

 🛠️ The Concept: Imagine a digital twin—a virtual replica of a physical structure—that constantly communicates with the real structure, helping us predict and assess safety, durability, and reliability. My goal is to develop a fast-response surrogate model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which will provide critical safety insights in real time! 🔄

Here’s a breakdown of how this works:

🔹 1. Virtual Twin: A detailed simulation (using advanced software like ATENA) of the real structure to understand its behavior under various conditions.

🔹 2. ANN Surrogate Model: I’m training the ANN model to act as a quick-response prediction tool, learning from the data generated by the virtual twin, which in turn is based on nonlinear finite element analysis. Once calibrated, this model will be able to provide instant safety assessments.

🔹 3. Real-Time Monitoring: The goal is to develop an efficient ANN-based surrogate model that can help monitor the health of bridges and other critical structures in real time, without having to rely solely on complex simulations.
